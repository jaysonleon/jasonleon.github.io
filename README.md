## About Me

I started at Northeastern in 2019 in the 6-year PharmD program. I experienced working in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, and decided to change majors.

I started my coding journey in Fall 2022, with Harvard's online course, CS50. After completing the course, I began my first semester of computer science at Northeastern University.
